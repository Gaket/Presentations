> How often do you use Google?

^ Does it have all the answers? Have you heard a phrase that "googling is a necessary skill?" I believe it'll be the same for prompting.

# Part 1: Fundamentals of AI and ChatGPT
## Understanding the Basics

--- 

# Understanding AI

- What is Generative AI?
- What is a Large Language Model?

^ Chat GPT is one of many

--- 

> LLM is designed to create more text that is similar to the text in its training dataset

^ We are relying on the fact that the text in its training dataset contains mostly true facts.

# Terms

- Prompt
- Tokens
- Context window
- Hallucinations

---

# Introduction to ChatGPT
- Overview of ChatGPT
- Capabilities and Applications

--- 

# Basics of Prompt Engineering

- What is Prompt Engineering?
- The Role of Prompts in AI Responses

--- 

# Zero-Shot Learning

- AI responds without prior examples
- Relies solely on the provided prompt

--- 

# One-Shot Learning

- AI responds with a single example
- Relies solely on the provided prompt

--- 

# Few-Shot Learning

- AI is given a few examples to learn from
- Helps the model understand the context or task better

--- 

# Chain of Thought Prompting

- Let’s think step by step.

---

# Tweaks

- Level of formality
- Sentence structure
- Word choice

^ Example - LinkedIn copy / copy of a landing page

---

# Iterative development

> “A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked”

- John Gall, The Systems Bible

^ The inverse is true as well

---

# Iterative development

> “A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work.”

- John Gall, The Systems Bible

^ Build basis. Now, update it to. Now, add one more line…

---

# Be polite!
## Or demanding

^ The model is built on human conversations

---

# Up Next: Advanced Prompt Crafting Techniques

---

# Role Play

- AI assumes a specific character or role.
- As a Sales manager with 10 years of experience...

^ Experiment - ask to create a table with differences for 5/10/15 years

# FACTOR framework

- **F**ocus: Define the aim or objective
- **A**udience: Tailor to the intended audience
- **C**ontext: Provide detailed background
- **T**one: Specify the tone and formality
- **O**utline: State formatting requirements
- **R**eview: Review and refine the output

---
[.autoscale: true]

> "Given the focus on [Objective], for an audience of [Audience], considering [Context], in a [Tone] tone, following the [Outline] format, [Insert Your Specific Prompt Here]."

---

# Grading approach

- Ask to evaluate and quantify its response
- Ask to adjust

---

# Mega prompts

- NASA prompt
- "Mama" prompt
- Ideation prompt

---

# Create your own GPT

- Initial training
- Pretraining
- Fine-tuning
- Prompts
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)

# Main Applications of LLMs

[.column]

- Content Generation
- Conversation Agents
- Language Translation
- Sentiment Analysis
- Information Extraction

[.column]

- Summarization
- Question Answering
- Personal Assistants
- Data Analysis
- Creative Writing

# Use cases

---

# My personal use caseses

1. Write a programming script
1. Go up and running with a new programming language
1. Practice Spanish (Character.ai)
1. Proofread my LinkedIn post 
1. Boring things, eg split this text into Deckset columns
1. Knowing more about things

# Brainstorming

- Reverse Brainstorming
- Six Thinking Hats
- SCAMPER technique
- First principle thinking
- Second Order Thinking

^ Reverse Brainstorming: Explain this technique as thinking about how to make a service or product worse to gain insights on improvement. Demonstrate with an AI prompt example.
Six Thinking Hats: Discuss this method, where each 'hat' represents a different mode of thinking (facts, emotions, critique, optimism, creativity, and next steps). Show how AI can be used to explore problems from these various perspectives.
SCAMPER Technique: Introduce SCAMPER, a creative technique involving substituting, combining, adapting, modifying, putting to another use, eliminating, and reversing elements of existing ideas. Illustrate with an AI-generated example.
First Principle Thinking: Explain this as a method of breaking down complex problems into basic elements and reassembling them. Use an AI prompt to showcase this approach.
Second Order Thinking: Describe this as thinking beyond immediate effects to consider wider, long-term implications. Compare and contrast AI outputs using First Principle and Second Order Thinking.
