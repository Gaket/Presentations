# What is Working Genius?

* Concept by Patrick Lencioni
* Framework for identifying natural work talents
* Enhances productivity and job satisfaction
* Six "genius" types reflecting work preferences and strengths

^ The Working Genius model is a concept developed by renowned author Patrick Lencioni.
It's a framework that helps us identify our natural talents and preferences at work.
The model suggests that we all have specific areas where we excel, and understanding these can increase both our productivity and job satisfaction.
The concept breaks down work into six "genius" types and identifies where we are most naturally gifted and energized.

# Team Benefits

* We'll understand each other better
* No more square pegs in round holes
* Making the most of our small team
* Conflict reduction
* More "Aha!" moments
* We'll enjoy our work more

^ This Working Genius thing isn't just a fancy theory â€“ it's got real practical benefits for us. First off, we'll understand each other better. We'll know who's best for what job, so no more trying to fit square pegs in round holes. We're a small team, so making the most of everyone's strengths is super important. Plus, this could even help reduce conflicts because we'll understand why people think and act the way they do. And who knows, maybe it'll lead to more of those "Aha!" moments when everything just clicks into place about why your colleagues do something one way or another. And, hopefully, all of this leads to a better enjoyment from the process!
