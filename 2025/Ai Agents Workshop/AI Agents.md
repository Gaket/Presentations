# Agenda

- [10 min] From LLM to Agents
- [10 min] Demo
- [30 min] Practice
- [10 min] Showcase

---

# Goals

- This is not a deep technical workshop.
- The goal is to get you curious about AI Agents.
- And play with them with as little setup as possible.
- And to come up with your own ideas of how they can be used.

# From LLM to Agents

---

## Introduction: What are AI Agents?

- AI Agents are software systems that can perform tasks autonomously or with minimal human intervention.
- They can process information, make decisions, and take actions.

---

## Early Days of LLMs - Text Input/Output

- Initial LLMs could only process text input and generate text output.
- Used for tasks like text completion and question answering.

---

## Limitations of Early LLMs

- Limited to predefined tasks and data.
- No ability to interact with external systems or perform actions outside of text processing.

---

## Introduction of Function Calling in LLMs

- LLMs gained the ability to call functions, allowing them to interact with external systems.
- Requires Structured Output.

---

## Advantages of Function Calling

- You've got a function? LLM now can use it.
- Ability to integrate with APIs, browser network, etc.

---

## AI Agents

- Get a goal.
- Plan how to achieve it.
- Use tools or tool sets as needed.
- Decide, when the goal was achieved.

# Hugging Face's take on Agents

[.table]
[.table-separator]

| Agency Level | Description | How that's called | Example Pattern |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| â˜†â˜†â˜† | LLM output has no impact on program flow | Simple Processor | process\_llm\_output(llm\_response) |
| â˜…â˜†â˜† | LLM output determines an if/else switch | Router | if llm\_decision(): path\_a() else: path\_b() |
| â˜…â˜…â˜† | LLM output determines function execution | Tool Caller | run_function(llm\_chosen\_tool, llm\_chosen\_args) |
| â˜…â˜…â˜… | LLM output controls iteration and program continuation | Multi-step Agent | while llm\_should\_continue(): execute\_next\_step() |
| â˜…â˜…â˜… | One agentic workflow can start another agentic workflow | Multi-Agent | if llm\_trigger(): execute\_agent() |

^If many tech folks, show:

---

# Practice

1. Generate Gemini API key: https://aistudio.google.com
2. Create SmollAgents CodeAgent with network access and Gemini as an LLM
3. Create Browser Use agent that would work with a browser on your behalf
