# UX of an "Open an account" feature

1. No preauthorized zone in the app. "Go to the site"
1. Pre auth zone with a multi-step Choose an account feature.
1. In-app progress of application + Notifications
1. Virtual card after approval

^ The chicken or the egg dilemma. Apartment - Bank - Apartment. Ok, I found a way to use airbnb for my proof of address

# User experience depends on the app navigation

^ That's why if you check out existing views in iOS eevelopment, you'll see tabs but you won't see the Drawer

# Food for thought

* Mobile app - a commodity
* Customers expect high level of usability and feature completeness
* Advanced app may be a competitive advantage on a developing market
* Instant money transfer is possible for usual banks

^ The mobile app became a commodity long time ago. Customers expect the same high level of usability and feature completeness from both the neobanks' and the classical banks' apps. At the same time, having a more advanced and user friendly app may be a competitive advantage on a market that is not highly developed yet. There are some financial institutions that put a bet on that, such as Neo Financial.

# More ideas

Collaborative transactions engagement raises user activity and account balance

Neobanks bet on easing and automating collaborative actions: they offer split-the-bill services, crowdfunding links with built-in Apple Pay and Google Pay, and sharing accounts.

The community used for customer help saves resources

One of the distinctive features of neobanks is the lack of complete customer support: most of the user goals are already automated or can be solved by the user itself. The big bet is made on a community that answers questions on forums and replaces the first line of support.

Self-service and self-resolution are also achieved by developing a well-stocked knowledge base: it’s integrated within forums, offers cards or video instruction formats. Some neobanks like Revolut Business land users on FAQ pages as the first step of troubleshooting.

Several neobanks of Europe and the US consider subscription management as their killer feature. The bank identifies regular charges with the same amount, then matches them with its own external services database and marks these charges as “Subscriptions”. This is the way users see their subscriptions and their share of expenditure, also they can cancel the subscription.
