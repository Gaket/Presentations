More ideas

Collaborative transactions engagement raises user activity and account balance

Neobanks bet on easing and automating collaborative actions: they offer split-the-bill services, crowdfunding links with built-in Apple Pay and Google Pay, and sharing accounts.

The community used for customer help saves resources

One of the distinctive features of neobanks is the lack of complete customer support: most of the user goals are already automated or can be solved by the user itself. The big bet is made on a community that answers questions on forums and replaces the first line of support.

Self-service and self-resolution are also achieved by developing a well-stocked knowledge base: it’s integrated within forums, offers cards or video instruction formats. Some neobanks like Revolut Business land users on FAQ pages as the first step of troubleshooting.

Several neobanks of Europe and the US consider subscription management as their killer feature. The bank identifies regular charges with the same amount, then matches them with its own external services database and marks these charges as “Subscriptions”. This is the way users see their subscriptions and their share of expenditure, also they can cancel the subscription.
