# The chicken or the egg dilemma

TODO: pic of an account and an apart

^ I've just came to Canada. Ran into a usual story - you need a bank acc to rent an apartment, and you need a residential address to get a bank account

---

# UX of an "Open an account" feature

1. No preauthorized zone in the app. "Go to the site"
1. Pre auth zone with a multi-step Choose an account feature.
1. As #2 but with a virtual card right after approval

^ Ok, I found a way to use airbnb for my proof of address

# Hamburger Menu vs Bottom Tabs

# Hamburger Menu -> "Junk Drawer"

TODO: Drawer image

> Discoverability is cut almost in half by hiding a website’s main navigation. Also, task time is longer and perceived task difficulty increases.

-- Nielsen Norman Group[^2]

^ That's why if you check out existing views in iOS eevelopment, you'll see tabs but you won't see the Drawer

# Bottom tabs notes

TODO: 2 pics of bottom tab action

> Use a tab bar only to enable navigation, not to help people perform actions. [^3]

# Evolution of banking apps

Ecosystems vs Super Apps

China example.

More ideas

Collaborative transactions engagement raises user activity and account balance

Neobanks bet on easing and automating collaborative actions: they offer split-the-bill services, crowdfunding links with built-in Apple Pay and Google Pay, and sharing accounts.


The community used for customer help saves resources

One of the distinctive features of neobanks is the lack of complete customer support: most of the user goals are already automated or can be solved by the user itself. The big bet is made on a community that answers questions on forums and replaces the first line of support.

Self-service and self-resolution are also achieved by developing a well-stocked knowledge base: it’s integrated within forums, offers cards or video instruction formats. Some neobanks like Revolut Business land users on FAQ pages as the first step of troubleshooting.

Several neobanks of Europe and the US consider subscription management as their killer feature. The bank identifies regular charges with the same amount, then matches them with its own external services database and marks these charges as “Subscriptions”. This is the way users see their subscriptions and their share of expenditure, also they can cancel the subscription.
